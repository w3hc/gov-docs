# Plugins

The Governor contract allows us to trigger custom on-chain actions. When you deploy a Solidity contract and transfer its ownership to the Gov, the DAO is the only entity allowed to interact with functions marked `onlyOwner`. The plugins are optional functionalities you can add to your DAO.

We have a long list of plugins to be built. Feel free to join [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uSxzJp3J76) if you have ideas to share.

To add a plugin to your DAO, you would: 

1. Deploy the contract
2. Transfer the ownership to the DAO

Once it's in place, the community can interact with it via a proposal.
