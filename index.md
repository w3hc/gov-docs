# Welcome! âœ¨

[Gov](https://github.com/w3hc/gov) is a DAO framework built with Open Zeppelin's Governor contract in combination with NFTs. It provides **a coordination tool that fits the needs of everyday people**.

We're inviting orgs, federations of orgs, activists, neighborhoods, stewards of the commons, collectives, and all communities to create their own DAO. The [Web3 Hackers Collective](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/web3-hackers-collective) has recently released the [beta version](https://github.com/w3hc/gov/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta) of [Gov](https://github.com/w3hc/gov). We want to run a series of pilots and **focus on the impact evaluation process** of each DAO.

Gov is fully compatible with [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/). We use it to submit proposals and vote.

We're currently supporting the following networks: 

- Optimism Mainnet
- Gnosis Chain Mainnet
- Celo Mainnet
- Ethereum Goerli Testnet 
- Optimism Goerli Testnet
- Arbitrum Goerli Testnet
- Celo Alfajores Testnet
- Base Goerli Testnet
- Gnosis Chain Testnet
- Mantle Testnet
  
Also, we have successfully tested [Medusa](https://medusanet.xyz/) (Arbitrum Goerli Testnet only for now). This allows anyone to share a document **that only the members can decrypt**.

## Deploy your own DAO

You can find the deployment checklist [here](./deployment.html#checklist). Once you decided about (1) your mission statement, (2) the types of proposals you expect, and (3) the [vote settings](./vote-settings.html#guide), we can take an hour to deploy your DAO to the network of your choice. Feel very free to contact Julien directly via [Element](https://matrix.to/#/@julienbrg:matrix.org), [Telegram](https://t.me/julienbrg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/julienbrg), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uSxzJp3J76), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienberanger/).

### DAO membership NFTS

The membership of your DAO is represented by an NFT. One person, one vote. These NFTs can be viewed as 'membership cards'. They're customizable: you can submit a proposal to modify the metadata of your NFT.

### On-chain voting system

Open Zeppelin's Governor contract defines the voting rules: it allows members to cast a their vote, it counts the votes and execute the proposal if successful.

### Members vote to add or ban a member

You can add or ban a member of the DAO by submitting a proposal. 

### Easy to config, deploy and run

Gov is one of the easiest existing way to launch a secure and scalable DAO. 

### Fully compatible with Tally

You can use [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) to monitor your DAO, submit proposal and vote. 

### Extreme composability/modularity

The Governor contract allows us to trigger custom on-chain actions. When you deploy a Solidity contract and transfer its ownership to the Gov, the DAO is the only entity allowed to interact with functions marked `onlyOwner`. The [plugins](./plugins.html) are optional functionalities you can add to your DAO.

### Upgradeable governance settings

You can upgrade the voting parameters by a community vote. Learn more about the [vote settings](./vote-settings.html).
