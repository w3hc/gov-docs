# Web3 setup

We're working on an [onboarding plugin](/plugins.html#onboarding), but as of now you will need three things to use Gov:

- MetaMask installed
- Optimism added to your MetaMask
- A handful of Optimism ETH

## MetaMask

Tally is MetaMask-only for now, so you have to have it installed if you want to interact with your DAO, meaning submitting proposals and vote.

Go to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) official website, download and install it.

It is recommended to back up your MetaMask, so just follow the instructions and you'll be fine.

## Optimism

Tally supports several different networks, but as of now Gov only supports Optimism so you can use [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/10), click on 'Add to MetaMask' and that's it: you're on Optimism!

## ETH on Optimism

To interact with your DAO, you're going to need a handful of Optimism ETH. For example casting a vote costs less than 1 cent, but you still need to pay for this yourself. If you already have some ETH, you can use the [bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit). If you don't have ETH yet, you can buy 'ETH **on Optimism**' via services like [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/), [Transak](https://global.transak.com/) or [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy).

If you're not confortable with these things, feel very free to contact Julien directly via [Element](https://matrix.to/#/@julienbrg:matrix.org), [Telegram](https://t.me/julienbrg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/julienbrg), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uSxzJp3J76), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienberanger/).

# Why do you need MetaMask?

MetaMask helps you remain in control of your crypto-assets, including your DAO membership NFT. It is important because you don't want anyone else to use your NFT. You don't need to trust neither Gov nor Tally: you have a direct relationship with the other members of your DAO. 

# Other networks

- [x] [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)
- [x] [sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
- [ ] [OP Sepolia](https://sepolia-optimistic.etherscan.io/)

You can find the [full list of networks supported by Tally](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/tally-contract-compatibility/network-support) in their docs.
