# Pilots

We'll want to run a series of pilots, the [W3HC](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/web3-hackers-collective) (Web3 Hackers Collective) is one of them. The goal is to test things IRL and answer this question: 

**"Does using a DAO improves anything at all?"**

We would bet the answer is "yes", but we need to show everyone that using a DAO means an objective net benefit for the community. Do people participate in the votes? Do people get significantly more funding? Are contributors actually incentivized to take action? 

## Metrics

For each DAO, here are the metrics we'll be tracking: 

- Overall participation rate
- Total number of proposals
- Total number of hypercerts issued
- Total cashflow per week

## Communities

For each of the use cases presented below, we will accompany one group in the process of deploying its own DAO. We'll make a symbolic donation, follow up with each proposal.

Here are the communities that we want to work with in priority: 

- Collectives
- Neighborhoods
- Commons stewardship
- Classic orgs
- City halls participatory budget

There are a lot of other contexts where creating a DAO could make a lot of sense. Don't be shy! Let's [talk about your ideas](https://discord.com/invite/uSxzJp3J76).
